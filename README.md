# ELEN21-HPP
## _SOP/POS Minimization For N bits +Â Kmap &amp; Truth Table Generation!_
### _Compile >= C++17!_
----------------------

## The Library's Main 4 Functions:
* ***NOTE:** `SOP_str` & `POS_str`'s variable name string vector arg shall be sorted in __DESCENDING__ bit significance!*
1) `SOP_str`: _Returns string with a function in minimum SOP form!_</br>
              => Given either a `vector<string>` with variable names & `vector<unsigned>` of fcn results (as if from a truth table)</br>
              => OR a `vector<string>` with variable names & a fcn to apply to a generated truth table
2) `POS_str`: _Returns string with a function in minimum POS form!_</br>
              => Given either a `vector<string>` with variable names & `vector<unsigned>` of fcn results (as if from a truth table)</br>
              => OR a `vector<string>` with variable names & a fcn to apply to a generated truth table
3) `Kmap_print`: _Prints a K-Map to `stdout`!_</br>
              => Given either a `vector<unsigned>` of fcn results (as if from a truth table)</br>
              => OR a # of bits (# of K-Map vars) along with a fcn to apply across a generated truthtable
4) `TruthTable_print`: _Prints a Truth Table to `stdout`!_</br>
              => Given either a # of bits (# of variables in Truth Table)</br>
              => OR a # of bits and a `vector` or fcns to apply to the table</br>
              => OR a `vector<vector<unsigned>>` matrix holding fcn results (as if from a truth table)

## The Library's 4 "Function String" Helper Functions:
* ***NOTE:** Used to further manipulate fcns returned by `SOP_str` or `POS_str`!*
1) `xor_replace`:    _Returns `string` with fcn's expanded XOR/XNOR's abbreviated!_</br>
2) `compl_literals`: _Returns `string` with fcn's literals complemented!_</br>
3) `dual_fcn`:       _Returns `string` with fcn's dual!_</br>
4) `compl_fcn`:      _Composes "`compl_literals`" & "`dual_fcn`"!_

## The Library's 2 Additional Functions & Universal Constant:
1) `BCD_decoder`: _Convert `vector<unsigned>` of bits into a decimal #!_</br>
   => Helps with implementing "don't cares" in user-defined custom fcns
2) `TruthTable_fcn`: _Given a # of bits & a fcn, returns `vector` of fcn results across truth table!_
3) `DONT_CARE_BIT`: _Universal predefined constant - to be returned by user fcns if at a "don't care" row!_
